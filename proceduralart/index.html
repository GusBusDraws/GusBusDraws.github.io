        <h2>Rock, paper, scissors</h2>
        <p>
          This is a cellular automaton where each color represents either
          rock, paper, or scissors. To calculate the next cell, the neighbors
          of each cell that would beat that cell in a game of rock, paper,
          scissors (e.g. paper for rock) are counted. If the number of cells
          representing that state are above a certain threshold, the cell
          changes colors to match the winning state. To make the pattern more
          organic, a random number is added to the number of counted winning
          cells before it is checked against the threshold.
        </p>
        <p>
          This sketch is interactive! You can change the winning threshold that
          determines when a cell changes colors by moving pressing W and S
          (once you pass 8, it resets to 0).
          You can also change the range of the random number by pressing A and D
          (e.g. 2 picks a random number between -2 and 2, once
          again rolling back to 0 after passing 8).
