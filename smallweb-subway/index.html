        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>
          The Smallweb Subway is an experimental project that seeks to connect
          communities online using webrings.
          A webring is a list of websites that are linked together in a circular
          structure. The usage of webrings dates back to the early days of the
          internet before search engines were widely adopted and when there
          were no big social media platforms with discovery algorithms.
          Webrings were ways for people to discover
          new sites by clicking through conveniently organized links that would
          take you on a journey through the internet and put you exactly back
          where you started (hence the "ring").
          Usually these webrings would be grouped by some shared
          theme or interest, but it might also just be some friends that new
          each other and wanted to share traffic to their sites.
        </p>
        <p>
          In our current place on the timeline of Large Social Media and
          The Algorithm (praise be), this kind of
          personal connection feels like a lifeboat in the turbulent sea of
          seemingly infinite internet chatter.
          To me, these connections offer a sense of place
          that is more human than what can be offered by the large platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          The term "smallweb" or "indie web" is often used to refer to the
          portion of the larger internet that includes hobby websites
          maintained by one person or a small team for purposes other than
          trying to sell things. The subway system theme is my attempt at
          making the internet feel like a place where you can have neighbors.
          If a webring looks like a subway line, then having a friend at the
          next stop or maybe a couple stops away can make you feel like
          your little pocket of the internet might be something more like a
          neighborhood that you might be able to feel a deeper connection to!

        <h2>How does this webring work?</h2>
        <p>
          By the power of community! And also JavaScript! Since it would take a
          lot of coordination to constantly ask folks to update the links on
          their website every time a new site gets added/removed from the
          webring, a little snippet of code was written by Gus
          (with the help of a few resources) to check a single file hosted on
          GitHub and determine where links should go before and after each
          site. Only a tiny bit of code needs to be added to a site,wand all
          the heavy lifting regarding link management will be handled
          automagically!  It also means that anybody can submit a request to
          add their site to the webring by submitting a pull request at the
          <a href="https://github.com/GusBusDraws/smallweb-subway.js">Smallweb Subway GitHub Repo</a>.
          Check out the README.md there for more detailed instructions.
          If you'd like some help adding your site to the webring,
          you can also email Gus at smallwebsubway at gmail dot com.
        </p>

          This is a work in progress, so right now the Smallweb Subway is only
          made up of a couple lines (webrings), but eventually I plan to add
          more interest-based lines and a map to visualize the connectivity of
          the lines.
