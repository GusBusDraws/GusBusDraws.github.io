        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>
          The Smallweb Subway is an experimental project that seeks to connect
          communities online using webrings.
          A webring is a list of websites that are linked together in a circular
          structure. The usage of webrings dates back to the early days of the
          internet before search engines were widely adopted and when there
          were no big social media
          platforms with discovery algorithms. Webrings were ways for people to discover
          new sites by clicking through links on websites that people
          coordinated to connect with sites that may be grouped by some shared
          theme or interest.
          In the day of Large Social Media and The Algorithm, this kind of
          personal connection feels like a lifeboat in the turbulent sea of
          internet chatter. To me, these connections offer a sense of place
          that is more human than what can be offered by the large platforms.
        </p>

          The term "smallweb" or "indie web" is often used to refer to the
          portion of the larger internet that includes hobby websites
          maintained by one person or a small team for purposes other than
          trying to sell things. The subway system theme is used as a metaphor
          and as a way to make the internet feel connected and like
          something that can have neighborhoods!

        <h2>How does this webring work?</h2>
        <p>
          By the power of community! And also JavaScript! Since it would take a lot of
          coordination to constantly ask folks to update the links on their website
          every time a new site gets added/removed from the webring, a little snippet
          of code was written by Gus (with the help of a few resources) to look up
          a single file hosted on GitHub to determine which links should go before and
          after each site. This means that after the code is added to someone's website,
          all the heavy lifting regarding link management will be handled automatically!
          It also means that anybody can submit a request to add their site to the
          webring by submitting a pull request at the
          [Space Turtle GitHub Repo](https://github.com/GusBusDraws/space-turtle-webring).
          If you'd like some help adding your site to the webring,
          you can also email Gus at smallwebsubway at gmail dot com.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a work in progress, so right now the Smallweb Subway is only made up
          of a single line (webring), but eventually I plan to add more interest-based
          lines and a map to visualize the connectivity of the lines.
