          The map below shows a subway style network of webrings!
          Each line represents a themed webring and each
          station is a different webpage in that theme.
        </p>
        <p>
          On mobile, tab a station to see its info, then tap the info box to
          visit the site in a new tab. With a mouse, hover over
          a station to see the info and click to visit!

          Each of the "subway lines" above are actually webrings!
          That means that each "station" is actually a webpage with at least
          one navigation widget like seen below.
        </p>
        <p>
          To "ride" the subway,
          click an arrow in one of the widgets below, find the widget on the
          next webpage, and continue clicking through to new pages!
          Eventually you'll end up back here.

        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>
          The Smallweb Subway is an experimental project that seeks to connect
          communities online using webrings.
        </p>
        <p>
          A webring is a list of websites linked together in a circular
          structure. The usage of webrings dates back to the early days of the
          internet before search engines were widely adopted and when there
          were no big social media platforms with discovery algorithms.
          Webrings were ways for people to discover
          new sites by clicking through conveniently organized links,
          eventually bringing you back to
          where you started.
        </p>
        <p>
          In our current time of Large Social Media and
          The Algorithm (praise be), this kind of
          personal connection is often missing in the
          turbulent sea of internet chatter.
          To me, these connections offer a sense of place
          that is more human than what can be offered by the large platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          The subway system theme is my attempt at
          making the internet feel more like a place where you can have
          neighbors.
          If a webring looks like a subway line, then it's easier to imagine
          a friend only a few stops away!
        </p>

        <h2>Can I join?</h2>
        <p>
          Yes! You can follow
          <a href="https://github.com/GusBusDraws/smallweb-subway.js?tab=readme-ov-file#instructions-to-join">these instructions to join</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Essentially all you need to do is put two new lines of code on your
          site where you want the widget, then let Gus know you did, either by
          an email (smallwebsubway at gmail dot com),
          a DM on social media site (see sidebar), or a pull request!

        <h2>How does this webring work?</h2>
        <p>
          By the power of community! And also JavaScript!
        </p>
        <p>
          Since it would take a
          lot of coordination to constantly ask folks to update the links on
          their website every time a new site gets added/removed from the
          webring, a little snippet of code was written by Gus
          (with the help of a few resources) to check a single file hosted on
          GitHub and determine where links should go before and after each
          site. Only a tiny bit of code needs to be added to a site, and all
          the heavy lifting regarding link management will be handled
          automagically! You can see the code for the project on the
          <a href="https://github.com/GusBusDraws/smallweb-subway.js">Smallweb Subway GitHub Repo</a>.
